          Here at Better Days, we understand the struggles many men endure
          during their life.
          Our belief is that many categories of men are being underrepresented
          and as a result, resources can be hard to come by.

          provide you relevant and adaptive
          questions to allow us to provide the best possible resources to aid
          your treatment.
